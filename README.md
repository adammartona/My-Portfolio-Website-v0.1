# Adam Marton Portfolio Website
The first version of my portfolio website. Now I'm working on a new version, which created with React.js. I really worked a lot on these interactive animations. I'm bored when a page has a simple color background, so I made static noise like animation as a background in JS. I built this page from a scratch on my own.

Used libraries and technique :
-SCSS
-CSS: waypoints.css, bootstrap.css, animate.css, lightbox.css, fontawesome.css
-JS: jquery.js, popper.js, easing.js, typed.js, tilt.js
