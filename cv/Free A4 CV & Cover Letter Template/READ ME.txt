Hi there,

Thanks for downloading my free A4 CV and Cover letter mockups.

Due to licensing issues I wasn't able to include the icons I used in my own CV, but a quick Google or Behance search should bring up thousands for you to use and to personalise the documents as you see fit!

Hopefully this helps some of you out! All I ask in return is that you appreciate the Behance project and perhaps even like my Facebook page if that's something you don't mind doing! You can get to that over at www.Facebook.com/Batchsky

Any issues feel free to send me a message!

(Your pal)
